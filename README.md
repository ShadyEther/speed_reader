            "Increasing your speed means making your mind and body more alert, and therefore more likely to keep going strong for longer periods of time." 

By focussing one word at a time we can read more faster..

Trust me it works... <br> <br> 

How to use it?.. do one thing.. <br> <br> 

put your text in the text box..and press 'Spreed' <br> <br> 

set your wpm(words per minute)..and read with your heart.. <br> <br>
